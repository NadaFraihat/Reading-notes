## Binary and data
Inside PC we have wires and circuits which carry the informations that we save.
every wires, may it be on or off, which mean 1 or 0 and that is called bit.
More wires give us more bits and more data.

**Gates**
by using gates, PC can calculate the binary codes, and gives us output.

**CPU**
It calculate and proccess the information that comes as input wich logic and math rules.

**Hardware and Software**
We can't see the software as materials, but we can see it inside the screen as programming and games.
Hadrware such as mouse, keyboard and headphones.
