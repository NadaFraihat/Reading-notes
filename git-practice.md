# **Git**
**What is Git and why we are going to study it?**
It is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
The most thing that the git *specialized* that has high speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
Addition to this we can see the previous edited files, from us or from other programmer.

 **Version Control of Git**
 It is DVCS which can store data in a file made up from snapshots. 
 with this property, Git has the following features:
 1. can detect the presence of any corruption in the data
 2. will minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files
 3. extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
 
**Some commands that can be used**
 1. **git remote -v**: where it can display all the remote pages
 2. **git add filename**: new file will be added
 3. **$ git commit -m “Reasons of changing”**: it tells the coder what i edited each time
 4. **$ git push origin main**: It push my new edited file into the cloud
 5. **$ git status**: to know the status of my file
 
 **After editing**
 *Keep in mind* the following steps show you how to edit you code:
1.  **git clone:** It creates a copy of an existing Git repository
 2. now write git clone and put the url of your web code, so now you copied all files and versions
 3. **cd filename:** now you have to open your file name which you had created such( reading-note)
 4. **code . :** to open VS code
 5. make your editing and addition into your code at VS code
 6. **git add . :** that means add all the editing that the coder did! 
 7. **git status:** it gives us the details if the editing change the origion code or is there and errors!
 8. **git commit -m " ":** now you have to write what did you change and why! write the commits inside the double qoutation
 9. **git push origin main:** this step push all your new code and editing into Git's file.
